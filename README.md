him/herself. However, the MMORPGs nowadays have the problem that the characters that users make are essentially "the same characters".
By this, I mean that they are not uniquely identified. The characters do have an essential division of roles that are defined by
the game itself, such as healers, damage dealers, tankers, etc. However, the characters from the same job have only "one guaranteed route".
Of course, the MMORPGs provide a lot of systems to uniquely characterized the users' characters. The best example will be "stat/skill distribution".

However, this is not the case. After a few months, the users of the game find out what the "best distribution" for each character job class
is, and this causes the users to all choose the same stat distribution for their characters, making almost all the characters inside their
given job class "strongest, but uniform". The same thing goes on for equipments, quests, and every other component of the game that "tries"
